# hello-world
In class work / group work

My name is Chayton Mousseau and I'm a IST major, just changed from CS and it has helped me get internships and get more experiences in the real world jobs. I also love anything tech, love gaming, love staying active, and excited to gradutate. 
I just recently got into retro gaming and I got a GBA(Game Boy Advance) and Pokemon ruby and I'm on the hunt for a GBASP, and more pokemon games and retro games because it's just fun. I also am in the process of getting an internship and I'm very excited for it.
